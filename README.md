## What Is Android Alfresco Process Services ?

Alfresco Process Services provides highly scalable workflow and Business Process Management services in the Cloud and on-premises. With the Alfresco Process Services mobile application you can view your task lists, complete forms and collaborate with others. You can start new processes, attaching files, photos or videos for simple review and approve workflow or support more complex business processes (complete with integrations to others systems). At any time, you can involve other people to collaborate to help complete a task. Alfresco Process Services supports shared task queues and the full process capabilities of the BPMN standard.
